    <h1>Rama’s Return</h1>

    <p>
      AAfter defeating Ravana and rescuing Sita, Rama fulfilled the purpose of his exile. With the war over and peace restored in Lanka, he crowned Vibhishana as the new and just king of Lanka. Soon after, Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana prepared to return to Ayodhya, as their 14 years of exile had come to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
     They journeyed back in the Pushpaka Vimana, a divine flying chariot given by Kubera and used by Ravana. As they flew across forests and mountains, Rama showed Sita the places they had visited during their exile, recalling past memories. On their way, they stopped at the hermitage of Bharadvaja Rishi, who welcomed them with great honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in Ayodhya, Bharata, who had been ruling the kingdom as a regent with Rama's sandals on the throne, anxiously waited for his brother’s return. When he learned that Rama was approaching, he rushed to meet him at Nandigram with great devotion and joy. A grand reunion took place as the brothers embraced with love and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana entered Ayodhya with great celebration. The people of the kingdom, who had longed for their return, welcomed them with lights, flowers, and joyous hearts. The city was decorated with lamps, and the atmosphere was filled with happiness and music. This grand return is remembered and celebrated every year as Diwali, the festival of lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rama was then crowned king of Ayodhya, beginning his glorious reign known as Rama Rajya—a time marked by justice, peace, prosperity, and righteousness. Under his rule, people were happy, truthful, and free from suffering. Rama’s return symbolized the victory of good over evil and the restoration of dharma in the world.
