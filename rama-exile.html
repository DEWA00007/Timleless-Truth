    <h1>Rama's Exile</h1>
    <img src="ramaexile.jpg" alt="Rama's exile in the forest" />
    <p>
      Rama, the righteous prince of Ayodhya and an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, was destined to inherit the throne from his father, King Dasharatha. However, on the eve of his coronation, fate took a dramatic turn. Queen Kaikeyi, influenced by a long-standing boon from Dasharatha and driven by the scheming words of her maid Manthara, demanded that her son Bharata be crowned king and that Rama be exiled to the forest for fourteen years. Bound by his promise and dharma as a king, Dasharatha was heartbroken, but helpless. Rama, in his deep commitment to truth and duty, accepted the exile without hesitation, comforting his father and reassuring the people of Ayodhya.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sita, Rama’s beloved wife, and Lakshmana, his devoted younger brother, chose to accompany him, refusing the comfort of the palace to share in his trials. Together, they journeyed through the vast and wild forests of Dandaka and Chitrakoot, living a life of simplicity and spiritual pursuit. They encountered sages, demons, and forest dwellers, and each moment became a testament to their strength, unity, and unwavering sense of righteousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rama’s exile was not just a physical departure from his kingdom but a divine path laid out to uphold cosmic balance. It was during this time that Sita was abducted by the demon king Ravana, setting the stage for the battle between good and evil. Rama’s trials during the exile revealed his divine virtues—compassion, courage, and an unshakeable commitment to dharma. Even in suffering, Rama stood as an ideal son, husband, and leader. His journey through exile continues to inspire generations, reminding us that true greatness lies in sacrifice, endurance, and fidelity to one’s principles.
